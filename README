CheckVersion is a TestLibrary for RobotFramework
(see http://code.google.com/p/robotframework/).
It is intended to check version information stored in executable files in Windows OS, mostly the ProductVersion and FileVersion information which could be important in case of a new solution package.

It is not platform independent because utilizes a small .NET program -- GetFVer.exe, source also included -- to get corresponding information from files.

CheckVersion is designed in spirit of KISS (Keep It Siple and Stupid) and it is also designed to use with robotframework-x.y.z.jar as a standalone (and portable) test tool. Currently x.y.z is 2.6.2.

Attribution, of course, is appreciated but not needed.

CheckVersion is based on the work of Lajos Nagy who made the original version of the GetFVer util. Parsing command line arguments is based on work of GriffonRL (see: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/3111/C-NET-Command-Line-Arguments-Parser and GriffonRL's page there: http://www.codeproject.com/script/Membership/View.aspx?mid=50981)

Thanks to Pekka Klärck for RobotFramework and the encouragement to publish this. I hope that it will help you.

Update @2013-06-11:
As a sideproject Ver2Csv has been developed and committed to collect version related informations recursively from a given base folder.
(see ver2csv.exe -h or the source itself for further details)
Additionally it has an enhanced version of command line parser where attributes not related to a switch are also available for processing.
