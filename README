CheckVersion is a TestLibrary for RobotFramework
(see http://code.google.com/p/robotframework/).
It is intended to check version information stored
in executable files in Windows OS, mostly the
ProductVersion and FileVersion information which
could be important in case of a new solution package.

It is not platform independent because utilizes a small
.NET program -- GetFVer.exe, source also included -- to
get corresponding information from files.

CheckVersion is designed in spirit of KISS (Keep It Siple
and Stupid) and it is also designed to use with
robotframework-x.y.z.jar as a standalone (and portable) 
test tool. Currently x.y.z is 2.6.2.

There was no decision about license at the moment of the 
initial commit. The publisher, Laszlo Szalai 
(lj.szalai@yahoo.com) feels himself no author but editor
and publisher instead.
